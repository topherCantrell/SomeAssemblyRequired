DASM80 is an MS DOS 2.0 or greater Intel hex file disassembler.  The
syntax for invocation is:

drive:DASM80 <hexfile> <sourcefile>

where drive: is the drive where the dissasembler is stored, <hexfile>
is the name of an existing object file in the Intel hex format, and
<sourcefile> is the name of the file to which the dissassembled code is
to be written.

Upon completion, <sourcefile> will contain the mnemonics associated with
the opcodes found in <hexfile>.  If an undefined opcode is encountered,
it is assigned the mnemonic "?".  An "ORG" statement is generated at the
address of the first non-NOP instruction.  If subsequent  NOP's (opcode=00H)
are encountered, the dissasembler will generate an "ORG" statement to the
address of the next non-NOP instruction.


The following is a brief description of each file on this disk:

DASM80.DOC is this file.

MAKEFILE is a definitions file for use with the MASM MAKE utility.

DASM80.ASM is the source file for the main module of DASM80.

MNEM80.ASM is the source file for the mnemonic lookup tables for DASM80.

DASM80.EXE is the executable program file.

ALL80.SRC is a source file that contains all source mnemonics for
8080/8085 microprocessors.

TEST80.BAT is a BATCH file that invokes DASM80.EXE to produce TEST80.SRC
from ALL80.HEX.

TESTZ80.SRC is a source file that was created by dissassembling ALLZ80.HEX.

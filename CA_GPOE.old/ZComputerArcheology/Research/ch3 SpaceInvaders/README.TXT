System Requirements
-------------------

dZ80 will run on any PC with approximately 200K of available DOS memory.


Installation
------------

To install dZ80, type d:INSTALL where d: is the drive (and, if
appropriate, the directory) which contains the install program, then follow
the on-screen prompts. After a successful installation, you may wish to add
the dZ80 installation directory to your PATH statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

Once dZ80 is installed, view the file DZ80.TXT, which contains the main
documentation.

The file WHATSNEW.TXT describes the new features in this version.


Description of dZ80
-------------------

dZ80 is a freeware Zilog Z80 Processor Code Disassembler for the PC. It will 
take a raw binary file and disassemble it to the screen, to a file, or both.
It also disassembles the undocumented, but often used, instructions. Including
those using the IXl/IYl and IXh/IYh registers, as well as the strange looking
"LD r, RLC (IX+4)" type instructions. It also supports the Z180 instructions
which fill up some holes in the EDxx opcode range. 

dZ80 is also available as a Windows 95 / NT program. It produces the same
output as this DOS command line version, but it has a front end and saves
the options used, between sessions. It's available from Inkland, where the
latest versions of dZ80 can be found.

I have released dZ80 as freeware, but I would appreciate comments or
suggestions, or simply let me know you're using it, by sending e-mail to the

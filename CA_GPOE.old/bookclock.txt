Plodding along in chapter 1 explaining how to poke values into memory. I truly hate the way the text is
coming out, but I'm going to force myself to get through it before looking back.

Unbelievable ... just the amount of sheer information that has to get packed into an assembly primer.
Chapter 1 could be the biggest chapter in the book.

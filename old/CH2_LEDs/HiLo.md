# LEDs and Switches

I keep a handheld yahtzee electronic game on the end table. Runs on 2 AA batteries forever. It has buttons and LCD display … essentially pixel areas that could be turned on and off.

Mattel Football 1977. Playfield was 27 LEDs in a grid 3vert x 9 horiz. Bright and dim. Bright you. Dim opposing football team. Move up down left right to move down the field to score.

In this chapter we will make a simple LED/switch game. Learn to use the tools. Introduction to assembly (Z80).

1978 Midway

Info from MAME
I8085 CPU (compatible with the 8080 - diference is the hardware bus)

It is looking for the following ROM images:

(In order as pulled into code segment)
invaders.h (2K) [0000]
invaders.g (2K) [0800] (Last half is empty)
invaders.f (2K) [1000] (First half is empty)
invaders.e (2K) [1800]

Memory Map
0000 - 1FFF	ROM (8K)
2000 - 23FF	RAM (1K)
2400 - 3fff	Video RAM (7K)
4000 - 57ff	ROM (6K)

I/O ports:
read:
01        IN0
02        IN1
03        bit shift register read
write:
02        shift amount
03        sound
04        shift data
05        sound
06        ?
Input:
Port 1
   bit 0 = CREDIT (0 if deposit)
   bit 1 = 2P start(1 if pressed)
   bit 2 = 1P start(1 if pressed)
   bit 3 = 0 if TILT
   bit 4 = shot(1 if pressed)
   bit 5 = left(1 if pressed)
   bit 6 = right(1 if pressed)
   bit 7 = Always 1
Port 2
   bit 0 = 00 = 3 ships  10 = 5 ships
   bit 1 = 01 = 4 ships  11 = 6 ships
   bit 2 = Always 0 (1 if TILT)
   bit 3 = 0 = extra ship at 1500, 1 = extra ship at 1000
   bit 4 = shot player 2 (1 if pressed)
   bit 5 = left player 2 (1 if pressed)
   bit 6 = right player 2 (1 if pressed)
   bit 7 = Coin info if 0, last screen

Looks like the 8085 instruction set is an ancestor of the Z80. In fact, there is
a disassembler with MAME that offers a switch to spit out Z80 type instructions.
Evidently, the 8080 instruction set is hard to follow.

First step -- use the disassembler source from MAME to construct a disassembler
for the 8085 and disassemble the ROM. GET PERMISSION FOR THE BOOK.
